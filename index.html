              <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;">Bio:</h3>
              <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> Hi my name is Josh and I am from Melbourne, Victoria. I along with the vast majority of my family are Australian born but a few of my older relatives are European immigrants. Last year, I completed my VCE with studies in English, Maths Methods, Chemistry, Economics and Software Development. <br> <br>In my spare time I enjoy going for long walks/ runs on local trails. While it is a lot rarer to see native birds along the trail (for a variety of reasons), I have always seen the beauty in seeing pairs of rosellas, kookaburras, cockatoos and rainbow lorikeets sitting on branches. </p>

          <h2 style="background-color:darkcyan;">Interest in IT:</h2>
              <div  style="background-color:aliceblue;">
                  <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;"> What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).  </h3>
                  <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> While my interest to study IT had peaked around last year, I have been studying IT and technology-based electives/subjects throughout high school. Originally, I had primarily enjoyed chemistry and maths but my interest had dropped off near the end of year 12. However, I really enjoyed software development in year 12 and I wanted to study more. <br> <br> Another major reason I wanted to study software was because both my parents have degrees in computer science and worked in IT. After seeing the diversity of IT and their different jobs, I desire to follow in their footsteps and work in IT. <br> <br> The majority of my IT experience has been at school – particularly software 3&4, I have completed minor side projects that I later implemented into my main SAT. Otherwise I have no work or post -high school education on the subject. </p>
                  <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;">Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </h3>
                  <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> One reason I wanted to study at RMIT was because it has a strong link with industry. Both my parents recommended to me Swinburne and RMIT since they have a strong link to industry and the majority of their colleges have either studied at Swinburne or RMIT. <br> <br> I also chose to study this course at RMIT (through OUA) because it had the option to be studied online. This allows me to be more flexible with other life commitments. While I do not currently hold a job, the course can be easily planned and worked around my working hours when I eventually get one.</p>
                  <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;"> What do you expect to learn during your studies? </h3>
                  <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> During my studies I want to build my knowledge of IT and develop my skills so I am able to analyse and solve a variety of IT problems. I also plan to improve my presentation and teamwork skills within a professional environment – particularly with the upcoming assessments. <br> <br> Last year in software development 3/4, I studied Visual Basic Community as my primary language. While it did teach me the basics of coding, other languages can provide me with the depth and structure to create different programs. <br> <br> I would also like to learn about different types of software development models. Last year I learnt about 3 development models: Waterfall, Spiral and Agile. Through studying this course, I want to learn how this process is fully run in a business setting along with other models used within the industry.</p>

              <h2 style="background-color:darkcyan;">Ideal Job:</h2>      
              <p style="background-color:powderblue;"><b><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56217299?type=standard#sol=755a5ccb6ceb5b8a9a30665e706402a7f3c92033"> Link to job on Seek </a></b>

          <div  style="background-color:aliceblue;">
              <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;"> My interest in the job:</h3>
              <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> Software engineers are programmers responsible for designing, developing, maintaining, testing and evaluating software solutions for a wide variety of clients. Software engineers create software to meet the requirements of clients (functional and non-functional). <br><br> As a software engineer at iGreenData, I will be focussing on creating 3 types of software solutions: cloud, data and digital. Each of these will be created to fit the needs of the client (mostly other businesses). These systems are made to last a long period of time and I will be required to also teach clients how to maintain the system. <br><br> I am interested in being a software engineer at iGreenData because I have a large interest in the whole cycle of creating a software solution. I really enjoyed completing my software development SAT last year which was directly designed around this line of work – Designing, developing, maintaining, testing and developing. Also, iGreenData utilise teams that work with an agile model. I also used an agile development model for my SAT last year and I enjoyed working alongside my clients to develop the software solution (instead of using a waterfall development model).</p>

              <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;"> Skills and qualifications required:</h3>
              <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> At a bare minimum, iGreenData requires that the applicant has at least 5 years of software engineer experience. iGreenData requires people with hands on experience with developing APIs, Java + Java frameworks, performance tuning, microservices and serverless architecture. The job requires that the applicant is fluent in writing code with HTML5, CSS#, JavaScript and React/Angular. Finally, iGreenData require the potential employee to be experienced in cloud computing and is comfortable working with any platform (AWS, GCP and AZURE). <br><br> iGreenData also requires that the applicant can work well in a team-based environment. This includes: being an excellent communicator, possess strong time management skills and be able to meet deadline by prioritising specific tasks. The applicant also needs to take initiative and always be driven to do their best for the project.</p>

              <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;"> Skills and qualifications I currently have:</h3>
              <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> I don’t currently possess many qualifications or experience since I just completed high school. As stated above, I have completed VCE and have studied Software Development 3&4 in year 12. I currently don’t have any work experience in a workforce. <br><br> During my VCE, I have adapted to learning in an online environment. During that time, I have participated in a few group-based projects last year.</p>

              <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;"> Roadmap to obtain skills, qualifications and experience required:</h3>
          <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> Firstly, I need to complete bachelor of IT (3 years ~ 2022-2025). During this time, I want to get a part-time/ casual job to gain some work experience. During my last years of my study, I may transition to an intern job at a tech company to gain some relevant IT work experience. <br><br>Once I have graduated university, I will still not have the proper experience to get the job. Instead, I will apply for a junior position at another company and work for the next 5 years. During my time I will become familiar with key skills and become more qualified in key areas required by iGreenData such as cloud computing. <br><br>Finally, I will apply for the job and hopefully commence working at iGreenData.</p>

            <div  style="background-color:aliceblue;">
                <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;"> What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
                <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> Through completing these tests, I learned a lot about myself. The results provided a more tangible insight of my personality type and learning style in a professional setting. <br><br> The tests indicate that I am an introverted but a hard and loyal worker (i.e. defender). As indicated on the Myers-Briggs test I desire to be a loyal and dedicated worker who helps the team achieve their best. I am realistic and practical; I prefer creating solid plans and sticking to them unless a better alternative is proposed. <br><br> However, my personality type comes with some weaknesses. I do have a habit of overburdening myself with too much work which can generate stress even though I am just trying to meet my own expectations. Sometimes I also struggle communicating my issues to avoid conflict with other group members. <br><br> My big 5 personality test also aligns with my personality test. The test indicated that I am greatly introverted and prefer working on more organised long-term goals than short term benefits. The tests also indicated that I am not really open with observing art complex self-expression. Finally, the test indicated that I am more agreeable being empathetic to other but have a higher tendency to experience negative emotions. <br><br> When it comes to learning new topics, my learning style test indicated that I am primarily a visual learner. I prefer to write down notes about what I am learning and often link them to a visual image. I tend to work at my best with visual learning material.</p>

                <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;"> How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
                <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> My results may influence me to be a positive member to my team. While I am not the best leader (or desire to go for that position), I will try my best to be a strong and loyal team player and get my work done on time. I tend to avoid conflict in team environments which can be beneficial to reducing team friction. However, I struggle to voice my own issues which can be a problem at times.</p>

                <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;"> How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
                <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> When looking for a team I should try to find people that I can connect with well. By “connect” I mean can collaborate with easily and share the same interests and motivations when completing the project. While I am not the best at it, I enjoy collaborating with peers in a constructive environment. From personal experience and the results, I find it hard to work in highly competitive teams due to my sensitive nature and aversion to conflict.</p>

          <h2 style="background-color:darkcyan;">Project idea:</h2>
      
          <div  style="background-color:aliceblue;">
              <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;"> Overview:</h3>          
              <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> My project involves designing a chatbot app for new clients of a B&B or a hotel. My aim for this project is to provide the hotel/ B&B with an app that can answer minor questions with text or verbally regarding to the place they are staying. For example, the Chatbot app can tell where the broom is stored without the client requiring to contacting other people for assistance. The chatbot will also provide an option to speak with an employee if the chatbot was unable to answer the query. The Chatbot app can also provide the user with physical images to help supplement their queries. Returning to the previous example, the app will provide an image of the broom sitting in the cupboard.</p>

              <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;"> Motivation:</h3>          
              <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> While chatbots aren’t new to market, they have been rising in popularity for both clients and businesses. In a report created by Drift, 34-37% of participants (image 2, Drift (author and site), n.d., “Why are Chatbots Important?”, last accessed on 18/3/22) preferred to use a chatbot for getting detailed explanations, resolve conflicts or getting a quick answer in an emergency. Chatbots are important in reducing the stress on call centres with client queries. In a B&B/ Hotel setting, chatbots can be used to decrease the number of clients requiring assistance from human employees. Chatbots can provide clients with quick and direct assistance instead of waiting for a response from an employee.</p>

              <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;"> Description:</h3> 
              <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> The Chatbot app is designed to be simple and easy to use for the client but have complex background features. Each of the features are broken down below through explaining how the interface functions as a whole. <br><br> The main homepage will consist of 2 buttons: “Start chat” and “settings”. The setting button opens a menu for the user to change the visual look of the app or change text size, voice speed, etc. The “Start chat” initiates a conversation with the chatbot and a variety of start-up questions are shown based off what the chatbot can do (all are listed and described below). <br><br> <b> About B&B/ hotel: </b> Used to answer questions relating to the hotel such as the history and heritage of the place or general queries about the B&B/ hotels guidelines or facilities. This button can also be used to show the pricing and bundles for additional nights/ services the B&B/hotel provide. <br> <b> Find something: </b> Used to answer client queries regarding the location of household items that the B&B/ hotel provide. This can vary greatly from location of cooking utensils to the storage of extra linen. Items will have specific tags based off key words that can be linked to the client’s input through the search.<br> <b>Local points of interest (POI): </b>Used to guide clients to local businesses or locations that may be of interest to the client. This might be food venues for lunch or dinner, potential locations for a day out (e.g. beach) or local markets.<br><b>Report an issue: </b>This button is used if there is a significant issue with the client’s venue. This button will branch off into several different problems: faulty/dangerous appliances, accidental damage or missing items.<br><b>None of these: </b>Used to indicate that the client’s question is unrelated to the previous types or it is more specific. The chatbot will attempt will attempt to answer the question but will more likely hand over to an employee for an answer. <br><br>The client is able to input their question via a textbox at the bottom of the screen or record their question verbally and have the chatbot convert it to text. This is used to simplify user experience and allow the client to input the information via a method they prefer. The chatbot will also be able to respond in text or read the response out loud with assistance of text to speech. <br><br> There will also be a button on the bottom the screen for the user to report a bug. This is used by client to indicate to the hotel that there is specific flaw in the system. This is to ensure that the developers can keep improving the customer’s interaction with application. <br><br> As indicated above, if the chatbot is unable to provide an answer to a client they are redirected to a helpdesk where an employee will answer their query for the chatbot. This feature is implemented to ensure the client gets the information they need to receive even if the bot can’t provide it for them.</p>

              <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;"> Tools and technologies:</h3> 
              <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> The base app will require a physical server for the chatbot to run off. The server needs to store basic information of the B&B/ hotel to base its answers off. Within this project a free/ cheap server has to be sourced. A basic app builder software (such as MIT app inventor) will also be required with the creation of the app and its base functionality. Also, I would require chatbot building tools such as Google Dialogflow, Hubspot or Freshworks. The chatbot needs to be programmed to answer questions based off the answers stored in the server and be able to retrieve the correct information. The chatbot also must have the ability to contact an employee directly if it is unable to answer the client’s question. If this was implemented for a client, a firewall would also need to be installed to help protect the server from unauthorised access. Also, the client business will need to have phones and link them to the server to receive calls.</p>

              <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;"> Skills required:</h3> 
              <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> There is a variety of skills that needs to create to get the chatbot app working. Firstly, the app that the client interacts with the chatbot needs to be programmed. Also, the chatbot attached to the app needs to be programmed to provide answers to a variety of questions and learn from future client responses. Both of these skill requirements can be fulfilled by app developers with minor experience in creating these systems. A SQL server developer with some work experience is also required to create the server that will host all of the B&B’s/ Hotel’s information. Sourcing programmers with some experience with creating apps, servers and chatbots isn’t particularly difficult with enough funds. However, within the scope of this project these skills have to be self-taught.</p>

              <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;">Outcome: </h3>
              <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> If this chatbot project is successful it would improve both client and employee experience. Chatbots reduce the strain placed on employees to provide answers to clients of the B&B/hotel. The chatbot app will act as a middleman that answers simple questions for the clients about B&B/Hotel without contacting additional staff to get involved. The chatbot app will also reduce the time the client spends to get their answer since the chatbot automatically and instantly retrieves the answer the client will need. Also, the decreased demand for calls will reduce the pressure placed on employees to answer client questions. Hence employees can spend more time on the more complicated questions and deliver a better service for the clients.</p>
