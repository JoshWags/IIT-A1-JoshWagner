      <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;">Bio:</h3>
      <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> Hi my name is Josh and I am from Melbourne, Victoria. I along with the vast majority of my family are Australian born but a few of my older relatives are European immigrants. Last year, I completed my VCE with studies in English, Maths Methods, Chemistry, Economics and Software Development. <br> In my spare time I enjoy going for long walks/ runs on local trails. While it is a lot rarer to see native birds along the trail (for a variety of reasons), I have always seen the beauty in seeing pairs of rosellas, kookaburras, cockatoos and rainbow lorikeets sitting on branches. </p>

      <h2 style="background-color:darkcyan;">Interest in IT:</h2>
      <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;"> What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).  </h3>
      <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> While my interest to study IT had peaked around last year, I have been studying IT and technology-based electives/subjects throughout high school. Originally, I had primarily enjoyed chemistry and maths but my interest had dropped off near the end of year 12. However, I really enjoyed software development in year 12 and I wanted to study more. <br> Another major reason I wanted to study software was because both my parents have degrees in computer science and worked in IT. After seeing the diversity of IT and their different jobs, I desire to follow in their footsteps and work in IT. <br> The majority of my IT experience has been at school â€“ particularly software 3&4, I have completed minor side projects that I later implemented into my main SAT. Otherwise I have no work or post -high school education on the subject. </p>
