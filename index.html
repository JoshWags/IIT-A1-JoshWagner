      <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;">Bio:</h3>
      <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> Hi my name is Josh and I am from Melbourne, Victoria. I along with the vast majority of my family are Australian born but a few of my older relatives are European immigrants. Last year, I completed my VCE with studies in English, Maths Methods, Chemistry, Economics and Software Development. <br> <br>In my spare time I enjoy going for long walks/ runs on local trails. While it is a lot rarer to see native birds along the trail (for a variety of reasons), I have always seen the beauty in seeing pairs of rosellas, kookaburras, cockatoos and rainbow lorikeets sitting on branches. </p>

      <h2 style="background-color:darkcyan;">Interest in IT:</h2>
      <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;"> What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).  </h3>
      <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> While my interest to study IT had peaked around last year, I have been studying IT and technology-based electives/subjects throughout high school. Originally, I had primarily enjoyed chemistry and maths but my interest had dropped off near the end of year 12. However, I really enjoyed software development in year 12 and I wanted to study more. <br> <br> Another major reason I wanted to study software was because both my parents have degrees in computer science and worked in IT. After seeing the diversity of IT and their different jobs, I desire to follow in their footsteps and work in IT. <br> <br> The majority of my IT experience has been at school – particularly software 3&4, I have completed minor side projects that I later implemented into my main SAT. Otherwise I have no work or post -high school education on the subject. </p>
      <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;">Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </h3>
      <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> One reason I wanted to study at RMIT was because it has a strong link with industry. Both my parents recommended to me Swinburne and RMIT since they have a strong link to industry and the majority of their colleges have either studied at Swinburne or RMIT. <br> <br> I also chose to study this course at RMIT (through OUA) because it had the option to be studied online. This allows me to be more flexible with other life commitments. While I do not currently hold a job, the course can be easily planned and worked around my working hours when I eventually get one.</p>
      <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;"> What do you expect to learn during your studies? </h3>
      <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> During my studies I want to build my knowledge of IT and develop my skills so I am able to analyse and solve a variety of IT problems. I also plan to improve my presentation and teamwork skills within a professional environment – particularly with the upcoming assessments. <br> <br> Last year in software development 3/4, I studied Visual Basic Community as my primary language. While it did teach me the basics of coding, other languages can provide me with the depth and structure to create different programs. <br> <br> I would also like to learn about different types of software development models. Last year I learnt about 3 development models: Waterfall, Spiral and Agile. Through studying this course, I want to learn how this process is fully run in a business setting along with other models used within the industry.</p>

      <h2 style="background-color:darkcyan;">Ideal Job:</h2>
      <p style="background-color:cadetblue;"><b><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56217299?type=standard#sol=755a5ccb6ceb5b8a9a30665e706402a7f3c92033"> Link to job on Seek </a></b>

      <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;"> My interest in the job:</h3>
      <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> Software engineers are programmers responsible for designing, developing, maintaining, testing and evaluating software solutions for a wide variety of clients. Software engineers create software to meet the requirements of clients (functional and non-functional). <br><br> As a software engineer at iGreenData, I will be focussing on creating 3 types of software solutions: cloud, data and digital. Each of these will be created to fit the needs of the client (mostly other businesses). These systems are made to last a long period of time and I will be required to also teach clients how to maintain the system. <br><br> I am interested in being a software engineer at iGreenData because I have a large interest in the whole cycle of creating a software solution. I really enjoyed completing my software development SAT last year which was directly designed around this line of work – Designing, developing, maintaining, testing and developing. Also, iGreenData utilise teams that work with an agile model. I also used an agile development model for my SAT last year and I enjoyed working alongside my clients to develop the software solution (instead of using a waterfall development model).</p>
      
      <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;"> Skills and qualifications required:</h3>
      <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> At a bare minimum, iGreenData requires that the applicant has at least 5 years of software engineer experience. iGreenData requires people with hands on experience with developing APIs, Java + Java frameworks, performance tuning, microservices and serverless architecture. The job requires that the applicant is fluent in writing code with HTML5, CSS#, JavaScript and React/Angular. Finally, iGreenData require the potential employee to be experienced in cloud computing and is comfortable working with any platform (AWS, GCP and AZURE). <br><br> iGreenData also requires that the applicant can work well in a team-based environment. This includes: being an excellent communicator, possess strong time management skills and be able to meet deadline by prioritising specific tasks. The applicant also needs to take initiative and always be driven to do their best for the project.</p>
      
      <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;"> Skills and qualifications I currently have:</h3>
      <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> I don’t currently possess many qualifications or experience since I just completed high school. As stated above, I have completed VCE and have studied Software Development 3&4 in year 12. I currently don’t have any work experience in a workforce. <br><br> During my VCE, I have adapted to learning in an online environment. During that time, I have participated in a few group-based projects last year.</p>
      
      <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;"> Roadmap to obtain skills, qualifications and experience required:</h3>
      <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> Firstly, I need to complete bachelor of IT (3 years ~ 2022-2025). During this time, I want to get a part-time/ casual job to gain some work experience. During my last years of my study, I may transition to an intern job at a tech company to gain some relevant IT work experience. <br><br>Once I have graduated university, I will still not have the proper experience to get the job. Instead, I will apply for a junior position at another company and work for the next 5 years. During my time I will become familiar with key skills and become more qualified in key areas required by iGreenData such as cloud computing. <br><br>Finally, I will apply for the job and hopefully commence working at iGreenData.</p>

      <p style="background-color:powderblue;"><b><a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/515f2b8542abc"> Results for Myers-Briggs test: </a></b>

      <br> <img src="Big 5 test.png"> <br> <img src="Big 5 test 2.png"> </p>
      
      <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;"> What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
      <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> Through completing these tests, I learned a lot about myself. The results provided a more tangible insight of my personality type and learning style in a professional setting. <br><br> The tests indicate that I am an introverted but a hard and loyal worker (i.e. defender). As indicated on the Myers-Briggs test I desire to be a loyal and dedicated worker who helps the team achieve their best. I am realistic and practical; I prefer creating solid plans and sticking to them unless a better alternative is proposed. <br><br> However, my personality type comes with some weaknesses. I do have a habit of overburdening myself with too much work which can generate stress even though I am just trying to meet my own expectations. Sometimes I also struggle communicating my issues to avoid conflict with other group members. <br><br> My big 5 personality test also aligns with my personality test. The test indicated that I am greatly introverted and prefer working on more organised long-term goals than short term benefits. The tests also indicated that I am not really open with observing art complex self-expression. Finally, the test indicated that I am more agreeable being empathetic to other but have a higher tendency to experience negative emotions. <br><br> When it comes to learning new topics, my learning style test indicated that I am primarily a visual learner. I prefer to write down notes about what I am learning and often link them to a visual image. I tend to work at my best with visual learning material.</p>
      
      <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;"> How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
      <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> My results may influence me to be a positive member to my team. While I am not the best leader (or desire to go for that position), I will try my best to be a strong and loyal team player and get my work done on time. I tend to avoid conflict in team environments which can be beneficial to reducing team friction. However, I struggle to voice my own issues which can be a problem at times.</p>
      
      <h3 style="background-color:cadetblue;"> How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
      <p style="background-color:aliceblue;"> When looking for a team I should try to find people that I can connect with well. By “connect” I mean can collaborate with easily and share the same interests and motivations when completing the project. While I am not the best at it, I enjoy collaborating with peers in a constructive environment. From personal experience and the results, I find it hard to work in highly competitive teams due to my sensitive nature and aversion to conflict.</p>
